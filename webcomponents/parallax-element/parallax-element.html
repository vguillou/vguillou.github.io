<!--
`parallax-element` is a container allowing nested
`parallax-layers` to to implement a parallax scrolling effect,
by implementing `Polymer.ParallaxScrollerBehavior`
The effect leverages CCS3 3D transformations.
This means that the implementation is efficient
performance-wise, and can be used on mobile.
    
    parallax-element > * {
      min-height: 500px;
    }

    <parallax-element>
  	  <div>My first normal DIV<div>
      <parallax-layers style="z-index: -1;">
  	    <div depth="-0.5">DIV srolling 25% slower and sliding under normal ones<div>
      </parallax-layers>
  	  <div>My second normal DIV<div>
    </parallax-element>

Children `parallax-layers` components __must__ be used to create
the parallax effect. To learn more about the usage of `parallax-layers`,
please refer to it's own documentation.

A `parallax-element` needs an explicit size to be set via CSS.
This size depends of the orientation of it's layout :
the height if vertical (default), the width if horizontal.  

    parallax-element {
      height: 100vh;
      width: 100vw;
    }

The orientation of the layout is vertical by default,
but can be changed using polymer standard built-in attributes :

    <parallax-element horizontal>
      <parallax-layers>...</parallax-layers>
    </parallax-element>

__Important notes:__ <ul>
<li>`parallax-element` must either be explicitly sized, or have and
explicitly sized parent. By "explicitly sized", we mean it either has an
explicit CSS `height` property set via a class or inline style, or else is sized
by other layout means (e.g. the `flex` or `fit` classes).</li>
<li>Children `parallax-layers` components __must__ be used to create
the parallax effect. To learn more about the usage of `parallax-layers`,
please refer to it's own documentation.</li>
<li>The `parallax-element` component being essantially a flex-box,
the children `parallax-layers` must be given a minimum size.
The property to set depends of the orientation
of the parent's (`parallax-element`) layout :
"min-height" if vertical (default), or "min-width" if horizontal.</li>
</ul>

__About the parallax effect and browser support:__
This component set uses 3D perspective and translations in order to achieve the parallax effect.
Unfortunatly, Internet Explorer does not support the CCS `transform-style: preserve-3d` and is therefore
not supported. However, the component will render correctly, as if the parallax effect was disabled.
