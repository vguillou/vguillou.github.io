<!--
A fast and customizable solution for client side filtering of arrays, made with and for Polymer.
Works with languages that do not use diacritics, such as english (see `poly-filter-diacritic` or
`poly-filter-diacritic-behavior` for diacritics handling).

Example:

    <poly-filter-en
      filter="[[myFilterOrQueryToSearchFor]]"
      array-to-filter="[[myArrayToFilter]]"
      filtered-array="{{myArrayAfterItWasFiltered}}"
      stop-words="[[arrayOfWordsToIgnore]]"
      logical-or="or">
    </poly-filter-en>

### Notes

If you are developing your own Polymer web-component with a filtering/searching functionality,
consider using the `poly-filter-behavior` directly for maximum performances.

If you want your filter/search to ignore accents and other character modifiers,
use `poly-filter-diacritic` or `poly-filter-diacritic-behavior` instead.

@group poly-filter
@element poly-filter-en
